# Projects
During the course of this class you will work in groups to develop variations
of an application, making use of topics covered in class. Each project will
incorporate features of the previous projects; however, code from previous
projects should be updated when appropriate to utilize newly learned language
features.

## Project 1
Project 1 should make use of topics covered during weeks one though three.

Create a program that allows a user to add, remove, edit, and list to-do items
by presenting the user with a menu similar to the following:

```
Please choose an option:
(1) Add a task.
(2) Remove a task.
(3) Update a task.
(4) List all tasks.
(0) Exit.
```

If the user chooses to add a task, the program should prompt for a description
of the task and add it to the collection of tasks. If the user chooses
to remove a task, the program should ask the user which item to remove and
remove it from the collection of tasks. If the user chooses to update a task,
the program should ask which task will be updated and for a new description of
the task.  The program should loop until the user chooses to exit.  

The program should include methods dedicated to adding, removing, and updating
tasks.

A runnable version of the program is available [here](files/Project1.jar). One
way to run this program is by downloading the file and running

```
java -jar Project1.jar
```

from a command prompt or terminal.



## Project 2
Project 2 should make use of topics covered during weeks four though six.

## Project 3
Project 3 should make use of topics covered during weeks seven though eleven.

## Project 4
Project 4 should make use of topics covered during weeks twelve though fifteen.
